Version 1

Overview: Changes colors in words using a word index based approach and RGB CSS generation.

Usage: 
1) Load JQuery, Load Plugin.

2) Setup word index as array of word positions. ( 'cat' is at index 2 in "The lazy cat snoozed upon the grey sofa" )
EX: var wordIndex = [0, 4, 14];

3) Setup color index as a nested array of RGB values
EX: var colorIndex = [ [0,0,0], [120,120,120], [255,0,0] ];

4) Call the plugin and pass in the settings.

$('#target').textPrism(wordIndex, colorIndex)

This will replace the HTML in #target with psuedo-spans around every word. This is what controls the color through a CSS3 :nth-of-type selector.
